					<h4>Web Design</h4>
					<p>
						<br>
						For this website, I used a Bootstrap-based template created by Colorlib (link to page in the
						footer). This template suited the kind of design I had in mind, complete with a consistent
						colour scheme and design style and a bold landing page. The benefits of using such a template
						are that it includes professionally developed CSS and JavaScript files, and generically
						structured HTML files which can easily be edited with relevant content for my site. This has enabled
						me to focus on the content of the site rather that spending time editing CSS and JavaScript files
						to achieve the precise styling I desired. In other words, somebody else has done the hard work for me. 
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-6">
				<div class="about-text">
					<p> 
						<br>
						<br>
						In order to edit my HTML files, I used Visual Studio Code due to its nature as a simple and clear 
						editor, which supports all of the languages required for this project and has useful syntax
						highlighting and suggestions. I have also used the Git version control system to keep track of changes made to the site and also to 
						enable me to publicly host the website for free via my GitHub account.
					</p>

					<h4>Domain</h4>
					<p>
						<br>
						As mentioned above, this site is currently hosted on GitHub at a URL generated for free. Taking this
						project further, a key next step would be to host this website on its own domain, for example
						'www.lacemate.com'. In order to do this, I would need to register this domain in my own name and
						also register with one of the many companies which can provide the server on which the site is 
						hosted. 
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-6">
				<div class="about-text">
					<p> 
						<br>
						<br>
						Many companies offer both of these services and also provide an online platform for accessing 
						the server and using it for other purposes, for example email or to databases for sales records. 
					</p>

					<h4>Websites</h4>
					<p>
						<br>
						For me, a good website is one which is simple and clean in style, easy to navigate, and tells you 
						all of the essential information about the company or project within the first scroll down the page. 
						Features that may help to achieve this include a meaningful logo, an engaging landing page, an informative
						slogan, and quotes, case studies or statistics regarding the product or brand. All of these features 
						help to give the person visiting the site a clear idea of what the company does and stands for, with minimal
						effort. Any kind of interactive features also make the site fun to navigate and will capture the visitor's 
						interest further. I think that a good approach in web design is to assume that the user has no prior knowledge
						about your brand or project and is not interested enough to expend too much effort navigating around the site
						to improve said knowledge.
						<br>
						<br>
						In order to make this website accessible, I have included 'alt' tags on all photos so that anybody who
						is visually impaired can still access and understand the site via a dictation tool. If this was not done,
						then such a tool could read out the textual content of the site but would provide no information on
						images, thus the site would necessarily make full sense. A side effect of this is also sending the message
						that visually impaired customers are not valued and therefore can be damaging to a business's reputation 
						and potentially damaging financially.
						<br>
						<br>
						Some of the most important considerations that must be made by web designers and devlopers regard privacy.
						The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in 
						the European Union and the European Economic Area. Under the terms of GDPR, not only do organisations have 
						to ensure that personal data is gathered legally and under strict conditions, but those who collect and manage 
			
					</p>

			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-6">
				<div class="about-text">
					<p> 
						<br>
						<br>
						it are obliged to protect it from misuse and exploitation, as well as to respect the rights of data owners - or 
						face penalties for not doing so. It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. 
						In accordance with these regulations, we would make sure that our website is registered under a secure server
						and that we do not hold onto any of our customers' personal information without their permission. 
						<br>
						<br>
						It is all very well for a company to have a good website but without appropriate marketing, it will receive 
						no visits and the company will be not make any progress. When publishing our website, we would need to consider
						search engine optimisation (SEO) and various marketing techniques such as advertisements, promotions and 
						demonstrations. Taking this project further, I would like to do live demonstrations of our product
						at potentially relevant events, as well as investing some money in targetted advertisements via social media
						and editing the textual content of our website in accordance with SEO principles.
						<br>
						<br>
						If we had more tima, I would like to improve our website to include a video demonstration of the product 
						as the background for the landing page, as well as case studies for people who have tested our product and 
						a page at which our product could be purchased.
